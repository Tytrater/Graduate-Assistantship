      "#### Adding the 3rd cluster does not help partition the data. By comparing the silhouette scores between a kmeans with 2 and 3 clusters, we can see that there is a score decrease. Also, looking at the count in each cluster, it appears that one of the clusters in the 2 node set was just split into two. So a lower score suggests a less efficient model with 2 verus three clusters.  However, if you are able to isolate a particular feature of interest within a specific cluster, it still might be useful regardless of the overall scores.\n",

As we see from this example, one of the clusters improved but the other degraded. If one of the clusters is more interesting for some reason, and we can improve the performance for that cluster, then this would be a wiin.  Not all clusters may be improved, however, and an increase in one cluster may be offset by a decrease in another.  Therefore, the technique is useful but may be situational depending on the cluster(s) of interest for your analysis.\n"
